Project Summary: Photo Editor Challenge

Below is a basic explaination of my thought process and brainstorming before wokring on the challenge.


1. Project Planning and Requirements Gathering
Define Objectives: The goal was to create a photo editing application using SwiftUI that allows users to apply various filters and adjustments to images.

User Stories: Key functionalities were outlined, such as image selection, adjustment sliders, and filter application.

2. Design

SwiftUI for UI: Utilizing SwiftUI allowed for a declarative approach to building user interfaces, making the UI more intuitive and easier to manage.
CoreImage for Processing: Leveraged CoreImage for image processing, which provides powerful capabilities for manipulating images efficiently.

3. Implementation
State Management: Used @State properties to manage the state of the selected and processed images, ensuring smooth user interactions and real-time updates.
Modular Components: Created reusable components like SliderWithLabel and GridStack to promote code reuse and maintainability.
Custom Filters: Developed functions for various filters, encapsulating the processing logic in a dedicated class, PhotoProcessor, to keep the view code clean and focused.

4. Testing
Test-Driven Development (TDD): Employed TDD practices by writing tests first, ensuring that the implementation met defined requirements. This practice improved code reliability and facilitated easier refactoring.
Swift Testing Framework: Integrated Apple's new Swift Testing framework to create simple, clear tests with minimal boilerplate. This enhanced the testing experience with expressive assertions.
Basic Test Coverage: Implemented basic test cases to verify the functionality of image handling and processing logic, ensuring the code behaves as expected under various scenarios.

5. User Experience
Simple and Intuitive UI: Focused on user experience by designing a clean and straightforward interface that allows users to easily select images and adjust settings.
Feedback Mechanisms: Included visual feedback, such as displaying the selected and processed images, enhancing the interactivity of the application.

6. Best Practices Followed
Separation of Concerns: Maintained a clear division between the UI, business logic, and data handling, improving code readability and maintainability.
Code Reusability: Designed reusable components and functions to minimize code duplication, making future enhancements easier.
Version Control: Utilized Git for version control, allowing for effective collaboration, change tracking, and code review.
Documentation: Added comments and documentation throughout the codebase, aiding future developers in understanding the project's architecture and logic.

7. Deployment and Maintenance
Scalability: Built with scalability in mind, allowing for the addition of new features (such as more filters or image effects) without major overhauls to the existing codebase.
Ongoing Maintenance: Established a plan for regular updates and maintenance to address any bugs or performance issues that may arise post-deployment.
